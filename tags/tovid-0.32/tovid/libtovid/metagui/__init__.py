"""A simplified GUI-writing module.

This module provides a simplified approach to creating GUIs for
command-line programs. It's designed so _anyone_ can easily write their
own GUI, without having any programming experience.

It assumes your GUI is a direct frontend to one or more command-line programs,
with each command-line option having an associated GUI control widget. Several
kinds of widget are provided, for setting Filename, Color, Number or Font, or
for picking a Choice or Flag.

You probably know of a handful of command-line applications that would be
much better with a GUI, even a cheesy-looking Tkinter one. This module makes
it easy to create one.


DEFINE CONTROLS

Say, if you have a program that takes input and output filenames::

    $ tovid -in movie.avi -out movie_encoded

then you can create GUI widgets for those options like this::

    Filename('Input filename', '-in')
    Filename('Output prefix', '-out')

These have the general format:

    Control('Label', '-option', ...)

where:

    Control
        is a Control subclass, such as Filename, Choice, or Number,
        describing what type of value is being controlled;
    '-option'
        is a command-line option whose value is set by the Control; and
    'Label'
        is the text that should appear next to the GUI Control.

Other parameters include default value, help/tooltip text to show, allowable
values, and hints about how to draw the GUI control widget; they are specific
to the flavor of Control being used.    

For a full list of available Control subclasses and how to use them,
see libtovid/metagui/control.py.


CREATING THE GUI

Controls can be grouped together either vertically or horizontally (using a
VPanel or HPanel, respectively)::

    general = VPanel('General',
        Filename('Background audio file', '-bgaudio'),
        Flag('Create submenus', '-submenus'),
        Number('Length of menu (seconds)', '-menu-length', 0, 120)
        )

This will create three GUI widgets in a panel labeled 'General': one for typing
or browsing to a filename, one for enabling or disabling submenus, and another 
for setting menu length to a number between 0 and 120. You can nest panels
inside one another for grouping; sub-panels have their own label and list of
Controls or sub-Panels.

Once you have a panel, you can create an Application::

    app = Application('todisc', [general])

This says your application will run the 'todisc' command-line program,
passing options set by the 'General' panel. Now, create the GUI::

    gui = GUI('MyGUI', [app])
    gui.run()

This creates the GUI, draws all the widgets, and will run your command-line
program at the push of a button.


CREATE A MULTI-PANEL GUI

If your program has a lot of options, one panel may not be enough to hold them
all without looking cluttered, so you may break them down into multiple Panels,
which will be shown in the GUI as tabs that you can switch between. Create
Panels like this::

    thumbs = Panel('Thumbnails',
        Color('Mist color', '-thumb-mist-color', ...),
        Text('Wave', '-wave', ...)
    )
    text = Panel('Text',
        Font('Menu font face', '-menu-font', ...),
        Number('Menu font size', '-menu-fontsize', ...)
    )

then, create the Application and GUI::

    todisc = Application('todisc', [thumbs, text])
    gui = GUI('MyGUI', [todisc])
    gui.run()

If multiple panels are given to Application, a tabbed interface is created,
with one tab for each panel.
