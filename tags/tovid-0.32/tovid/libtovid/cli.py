"""This module provides an interface for running command-line applications.
Two primary classes are provided:

    Command
        For constructing and executing command-line commands
    Pipe
        For piping commands together

Commands are constructed by specifying a program to run, and each separate
argument to pass to that program. Arguments are used in a platform-independent
way, so there is no need to escape shell-specific characters or do any quoting
of arguments.

Commands may be executed in the foreground or background; they can print their
output on standard output, or capture it in a string variable.

For example::

    >>> echo = Command('echo', "Hello world")
    >>> echo.run()                                # doctest: +SKIP
    Hello world

Commands may be connected together with pipes::

    >>> sed = Command('sed', 's/world/nurse/')
    >>> pipe = Pipe(echo, sed)
    >>> pipe.run()                                # doctest: +SKIP
    Hello nurse

Command output may be captured and retrieved later with get_output()::

    >>> echo.run(capture=True)                    # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> echo.get_output()
    'Hello world\\n'

"""
# Note: Some of the run() tests above will fail doctest.testmod(), since output
# from Command subprocesses is not seen as real output by doctest. The current
# workaround is to use the "doctest: +SKIP" directive (new in python 2.5).
# For other directives see http://www.python.org/doc/lib/doctest-options.html
