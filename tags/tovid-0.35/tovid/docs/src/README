tovid documentation
http://tovid.wikia.com/

This is the README for the tovid txt2tags (.t2t) documentation
sources.

The directory containing this README has a subdirectory for each
language; the 'en' directory contains English documentation, the
'es' Español, and so forth. In these are '.t2t' files, which are
written in the plain-text "txt2tags" markup language described
here:

    http://txt2tags.sf.net/

If you would like to translate the documentation to another language,
simply create a new subdirectory ('fr', 'it', etc.) and place your
translated .t2t files into it. Even if you only want to translate
some of the files, your help will go a long way towards bringing
tovid to a wider audience.

If you've found a typo, or just want to help improve the existing
documentation, please feel free to modify the existing .t2t files!

Email your modified or translated .t2t files to wapcaplet88@yahoo.com.
