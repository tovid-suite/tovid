Video disc authoring software
=====================================================

This file contains configuration and installation instructions for tovid.

=====================================================
INSTALLING FROM DISTRIBUTED SOURCE (*.tar.gz)
=====================================================

To install an official source distribution of tovid (from a tarball such as
tovid-0.30.tar.gz), or from a quick-release, first extract the .tar.gz file,
then do:

    $ su -c './setup.py install'
    or
    $ sudo ./setup.py install

If you want to install to somewhere other than /usr/local, you can use:
    $ su -c './setup.py install --prefix=/opt' for example.
Note: with some versions of python's distutils this will by default install
modules to .../site-packages rather than .../dist-packages even if that is
where your system's python looks for them.  See:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python2.6/+bug/362570
As a workaround, if you are using --prefix you can add:
 --install-layout=deb .


If you want to uninstall tovid, do this:

    $ su -c './setup.py uninstall'
    or
    $ sudo ./setup.py uninstall

See the tovid homepage (http://tovid.wikia.com/) for additional documentation.


=====================================================
INSTALLING FROM SUBVERSION
=====================================================

New subversion check-outs have two files that must be "compiled"
prior to installation:

    docs/man/tovid.1
    src/tovid-init

To build the manpage, you will need txt2tags:

    http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net

Run these commands to build the necessary files:

    $ ./setup.py build_docs
    $ ./setup.py build_tovid_init

Then run ./setup.py install as superuser:

    $ su -c './setup.py install'
    or
    $ sudo ./setup.py install


=====================================================
BUILDING A DISTRIBUTABLE ARCHIVE
=====================================================

If you are a developer or packager, you may wish to consult the distutils
documentation for more information:

    http://docs.python.org/library/distutils.html

To build a distributable .tar.gz file of tovid, first build the manpage and
tovid-init:

    $ ./setup.py build_docs
    $ ./setup.py build_tovid_init

Then do the build and sdist:

    $ ./setup.py build
    $ ./setup.py sdist

Most of the files to include in the distribution are determined by what's
listed in the setup.py setup() method; any extra files for distribution are
listed in the MANIFEST.in file in this directory.
