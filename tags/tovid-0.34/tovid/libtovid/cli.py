"""This module provides an interface for running command-line applications.
Two primary classes are provided:

    `Command`
        For constructing and executing command-line commands
    `Pipe`
        For piping commands together

Commands are constructed by specifying a program to run, and each separate
argument to pass to that program. Arguments are used in a platform-independent
way, so there is no need to escape shell-specific characters or do any quoting
of arguments.

Commands may be executed in the foreground or background; they can print their
output on standard output, or capture it in a string variable.

For example::

    >>> echo = Command('echo', "Hello world")
    >>> echo.run()                                # doctest: +SKIP
    Hello world

Commands may be connected together with pipes::

    >>> sed = Command('sed', 's/world/nurse/')
    >>> pipe = Pipe(echo, sed)
    >>> pipe.run()                                # doctest: +SKIP
    Hello nurse

The above can be easily accomplished using Python standard library functions
like ``os.Popen`` or ``commands.getoutput``. This module was designed to
simplify the task of executing long-running commands or command-line pipes in
the background, and getting their output later. This behavior is controlled by
the arguments to the `~Command.run` method.

Normally, `~Command.run` prints all output on standard output. If instead you
need to capture the output, pass ``capture=True``, then retrieve it later with
`~Command.get_output`::

    >>> echo.run(capture=True)                    # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> echo.get_output()
    'Hello world\\n'

If the command you're running will take a long time to run, and you don't want
your program to be blocked while it's running, pass ``background=True``. If the
command may produce a lot of output during execution, you'll probably want to
capture it instead of printing it::

    >>> find = Command('find', '/')               # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> find.run(capture=True, background=True)

In this way, your application can keep doing other things while the long-running
command is executing; you can check whether it's done like so::

    >>> find.done()
    False
    >>> find.done()
    False
    >>> find.done()
    True

Then, as before, use `~Command.get_output` to get the output, if you need it. If
you need to get the standard error output, use `~Command.get_errors`.

"""
# Note: Some of the run() tests above will fail doctest.testmod(), since output
# from Command subprocesses is not seen as real output by doctest. The current
# workaround is to use the "doctest: +SKIP" directive (new in python 2.5).
# For other directives see http://www.python.org/doc/lib/doctest-options.html

# TODO: Make the 'capture/get_output' mechanisms able to handle large amounts
# of output, perhaps by logging to a temporary file and/or returning an iterator
# for lines of output, instead of a flat string.
