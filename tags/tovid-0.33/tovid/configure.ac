# Python
# ******************************************************************************
# As seen on http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Python
# AM_PATH_PYTHON sets many vars, including $(pythondir), which is the directory
# name for the site-packages subdirectory of the standard Python install tree;
# and $(pyexecdir), which is the directory where Python extension modules
# (shared libraries) should be installed.

# For example, on friedrij's woody debian system
# $(pythondir) = ${prefix}/lib/python2.3/site-packages
# $(pyexecdir) = ${exec_prefix}/lib/python2.3/site-packages

# From the autoconf manual, available in anything _but_ html (uf, fsf) from
# http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/index.html
# $(prefix) is "The common installation prefix for all files. If $(exec_prefix)
# is defined to a different value, prefix is used only for architecture-
# independent files."
# $(exec_prefix) is "The installation prefix for architecture-dependent files.
# By default it's the same as $(prefix). You should avoid installing anything
# directly to $(exec_prefix). However, the default value for directories
# containing architecture-dependent files should be relative to $(exec_prefix)."

# The GNU Coding Standards, available in html (yosh) from
# (http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Directory-Variables),
# clarifies the difference between $(prefix) and $(exec_prefix): "Generally,
# $(exec_prefix) is used for directories that contain machine-specific files
# (such as executables and subroutine libraries), while $(prefix) is used
# directly for other directories."

# So, this dev thinks we need $(pythondir) and some 'enlightened' python
# scripts, as pointed out by
# http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html#Hard_002dCoded-Install-Paths
# If you do [use $(pythondir) or $(pyexecdir)], then:
#    * root users can install your package with the same --prefix as Python (you
#      get the behavior of the previous attempt - eg /usr/lib/python-2.3/...)
#    * non-root users can install your package too, they will have the extension
#      module in a place that is not searched by Python but they can work around
#      this using environment variables (and if you installed scripts that use
#      this shared library, it's easy to tell Python were to look in the
#      beginning of your script, so the script works in both cases).

# Using pythondir_PYTHON for libtovid will install it to
# ${prefix}/lib/python2.3/site-packages (for example)
# and the pytovid suite (left as bin_SCRIPTS, so that they are installed as
# executables and not byte-compiled like python_PYTHON would do) will need to be
# told how to look for libtovid.
